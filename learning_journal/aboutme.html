          <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
          <p>
            I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
            and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
            learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was
            fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
            most things about my journey with the world.
          </p>
          <h4>How I got started</h4>
          <p>
            I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
            take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
            use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
            short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me
            grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
            summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
